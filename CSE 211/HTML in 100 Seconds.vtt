00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.639
hypertext markup language or HTML is a

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.640
language that defines the structure of

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.520
content on a web page development

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.719
started in 1989 at CERN by Tim burner

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.320
Lee who had just invented the world's

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.519
first web browser worldwide web the

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840
origin of www but he needed a publishing

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.880
language to display content within it so

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.199
he chose a syntax based on the standard

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.279
generalized markup language which uses

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.080
opening and closing tags to provide

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.519
meaning to otherwise unorganized text

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.000
like H for heading p for paragraph and

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.719
most importantly a for anchor to link to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.239
a different web page the language

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:36.760
underwent many changes during the

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.320
initial rise of the internet and was

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.239
standardized as HTML 5 in 2008 the

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.120
version we know and love today modern

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.719
HTML contains tags to handle a variety

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.840
of different media types like video

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.399
audio and canvas to draw custom graphics

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760
on the Fly the typical HTML element

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.039
starts with an opening and closing tag

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.800
in the middle we have content which

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.920
might be text or additional HTML

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.239
elements called children the opening tag

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.320
may also have one or more attributes

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.960
which are key value pairs that can

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.000
customize the appearance or behavior of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.960
the element to build your first web page

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.640
create a file named

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.720
index.html this file contains a

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.799
hierarchy of nodes based on the document

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.439
object model or Dom a web page starts

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.920
with an HTML tag and has exactly two

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.680
children a head and a body the head

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.240
contains things that aren't directly

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840
shown in the web page like a title or a

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.360
meta tag to give the page a description

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.200
but notice how The Meta element has no

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.399
closing tag closing tags are generally

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.079
optional when an element is fully

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.119
self-contained the body contains the

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.280
actual UI for the end user we might

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.320
start with an H1 heading followed by a

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.640
paragraph of content to add an image we

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.640
use an image tag which you'll notice is

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.640
self closing then Define The Source

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.960
attribute as the file path to the image

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960
and you'll want to give it an ALT

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.680
description to make it accessible to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.680
robots and Screen readers what makes web

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.280
pages revolutionary though is their

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.320
ability to link to other web pages on

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.200
the information Super Highway use an

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.159
anchor tag to create a link then Define

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.360
the hre attribute as the web page that

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.240
you want to navigate to when clicked

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.679
HTML also provides structural tags like

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.160
division or div which are often used to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.640
group elements together where they can

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760
be styled to represent complex UI

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.480
elements like navb bars when you're

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.160
happy with your code grab the full file

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.640
path to the HTML file and paste it into

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.879
